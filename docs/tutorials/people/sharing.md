One of the powerful features of RecipeSage that sets it apart from other recipe keepers is it's powerful sharing capabilities.

There are many ways to share content in RecipeSage, including recipes, meal plans, and shopping lists.

## Sharing Recipes

There are three main ways of sharing recipes.

For sharing recipes one-off, you can follow the steps described [here](../recipes/recipe-details.md#sharing). This is best for if you have a single recipe that you want to share with either another RecipeSage user, or someone with no account.

For sharing multiple recipes, the [profile feature](./your-profile.md) within RecipeSage is recommended. You can create a profile, then add recipes to that profile and share a handy link with friends.

If you'd like to share a single recipe in hardcopy, you'll probably want to [print](../recipes/recipe-details.md#printing) the recipe. To share multiple recipes at once via hardcopy, you can print all of your recipes by [exporting them to PDF](../settings/export.md).

## Sharing Meal Plans

To share a meal plan with another user, simply add them as a collaborator when [creating the meal plan](../meal-plans/create.md)

## Sharing Shopping Lists

To share a meal plan with another user, simply add them as a collaborator when [creating the shopping list](../shopping-lists/create.md)
