<img className="screenshot" src="/img/recipe-details.png"></img>

This page is the detailed view for a single recipe. All of the information for the selected recipe is printed here, as well as buttons for various actions.

The page layout will change based on the screen size of the device you're browsing on so that it's always optimized. For the best experience, we suggest having a device large enough to where the ingredients and instructions are shown side-by-side.

## Scaling

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/recipe-details-scale.png"></img>

Click the scale link to choose a different recipe scale. A dialogue will pop up for the recipe scale. Enter a number or a fraction and the ingredient quantities (shown in bold) will adjust.

Keep in mind that any measurements that are not shown in bold aren't recognized and won't be scaled.

Values entered into the scale field are not permanent. Once you close this recipe, the scale will default back to the scale entered in the recipe editor.

## Labelling

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/recipe-details-actions.png"></img>

Labels are an excellent way of organizing your recipes. Think of labels as folders, but where a single recipe can be in multiple folders!

To add a label to a recipe, enter the label name in the field below the labels header as shown above, and press enter to save.

Suggestions will be shown below the field as you type - they will be filtered as you type your label name. You can click a suggestion to automatically add that label. To remove a label, just click the trash can icon.

You can filter by labels on the my recipes page to see only recipes in a certain label.

## Sharing

There are three ways of sharing a recipe:
- Directly within the app to a RecipeSage user
- By creating a shareable link and sharing outside of the RecipeSage app
- By embedding it into a website

### To a RecipeSage User

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/share-recipe-account.png"></img>

The recipe sharing modal allows you to send a recipe to another RecipeSage user's account, share via link, or share via embed.

To begin the process of sharing a recipe to another user's account, press the share button at the bottom of the recipe details page (as described in the recipe actions tutorial). You'll then be presented with the share modal shown in the image above.

To select a recipient, type the email of the RecipeSage user you'd like to send the recipe to in the field recipient email field. The status below the field will update as you type. It will either report that the user was found (and will show their nickname), or it will report that no user was found with that email address.

You can also select the recipient from your list of existing conversations if you already have an existing message thread with the user (this list will not be shown if you do not have at least one existing message thread with another user).

After selecting the recipient user via either method, you'll be able to press the send button. After sending, a copy of the recipe will be sent to the recipient. Keep in mind that any modifications that they do to the received copy will not affect your copy of the recipe.

**Note:** To send the recipe to a non-RecipeSage user, see below (sharing a recipe by link).

### By Link

## Printing

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/select-recipe-print-layout.png"></img>

**Note:** If you're looking for how to print all recipes, see [Printing All Recipes or Exporting All Recipes to PDF](./my-recipes.md#printing-all-recipes-or-exporting-all-recipes-to-pdf) instead.

The print recipe modal allows you to print a hardcopy of your recipe.

To begin the process of printing a recipe, press the print button at the bottom of the recipe details page (as described in the recipe actions tutorial). You'll then be presented with the print layout modal shown in the image above.

In your system print dialogue, you can adjust margins, change color settings and select your printer. Depending on your browser and operating system version, your system print dialogue will look vastly different, therefore no screenshot is shown for this step.

**Note:** If you have trouble using this feature, try using Firefox or Chrome. Other browsers may not perform the same.
