This page is the detailed view for a single recipe. All of the information for the selected recipe is printed here, as well as buttons for various actions.

The page layout will change based on the screen size of the device you're browsing on so that it's always optimized. For the best experience, we suggest having a device large enough to where the ingredients and instructions are shown side-by-side.

## Scaling

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/recipe-details-scale.png" alt="Recipe scaling dialog"></img>

Click the scale link to choose a different recipe scale. A dialogue will pop up for the recipe scale. Enter a number or a fraction and the ingredient quantities (shown in bold) will adjust.

Keep in mind that any measurements that are not shown in bold aren't recognized and won't be scaled.

Values entered into the scale field are not permanent. Once you close this recipe, the scale will default back to the scale entered in the recipe editor.

## Labelling

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/recipe-details-actions.png" alt="Recipe action buttons"></img>

Labels are an excellent way of organizing your recipes. Think of labels as folders, but where a single recipe can be in multiple folders!

To add a label to a recipe, enter the label name in the field below the labels header as shown above, and press enter to save.

Suggestions will be shown below the field as you type - they will be filtered as you type your label name. You can click a suggestion to automatically add that label. To remove a label, just click the trash can icon.

You can filter by labels on the my recipes page to see only recipes in a certain label.

**Note:** If you're looking for how to print all recipes, see [📖 Printing All Recipes or Exporting All Recipes to PDF](./my-recipes.md#printing-all-recipes-or-exporting-all-recipes-to-pdf) instead.
