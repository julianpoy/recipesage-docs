## Authoring

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/edit-recipe.png"></img>

This is the authoring and editing experience for RecipeSage.

Fill in the corresponding fields as you wish - only the title is required. After you're done, don't forget to hit save!

To add an image, click the image holder at the top. Your browser will prompt you to select a file.

The best images are square - don't worry about size though, RecipeSage will optimize it automatically for thumbnail use.

## Formatting

Ingredients are divided by linebreaks, so have one per carriage return. Ingredient measurements will be automatically parsed, but as a general rule, use the format: `1 1/2 cup`. For a range, use the format: `1 to 2 cups`. This will help the scaling feature recognize your quantities as best as possible

Instructions are divided by linebreaks as well, so put each step on a different carriage return. Make sure not to have extra carriage returns in-between!

To add a header to your instructions or ingredients, put an open and close bracket at the ends of the line like this:

```
[The dough:]
1/2 cup water
[The sauce:]
1/8 cup sugar
```
