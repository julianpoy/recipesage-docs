## Adding to Other Calendar Programs

To add your meal plan to an external calendar program and keep it in sync, open the options menu in the top right corner of the meal plan page and click "share".

The link shown can be added to most calendar programs as an external calendar, so long as the calendar program supports ICS format.

For Google Calendar, you can add this link as an external calendar by:
1. Copy the ICS link shown in the share popup
2. Open your Google Calendar
3. Click the + icon in the left sidebar where it says "other calendars"
4. Click the "From URL" option
5. Paste the ICS link you copied from RecipeSage into the "URL of Calendar" field
6. Click "Add calendar"

Your meal plan should automatically sync to your Google Calendar.

**Note:** Google Calendar (and some others) will only sync updates every 24 hours. There's nothing that RecipeSage can really do about this unfortunately - it's a platform limitation imposed by Google.

## Options

<img className="screenshot" src="/img/meal-plan-options.png"></img>

**Start week on**: Switching this setting will change how the calendar is displayed. "Monday" will show weeks as Monday-Sunday. "Sunday" will show weeks as Sunday-Saturday.

### Actions

These bulk actions are explained in the other meal plan guides. You can use each by selecting a day (or multiple days), then clicking one of these buttons. The action will then be applied to all selected days.
