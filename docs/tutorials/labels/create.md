Labels are an excellent way of organizing your recipes. Think of labels as folders, but where a single recipe can be in multiple folders!

## Creating Labels and Assigning Labels to Recipes

Both creating a label _and_ adding a label to a recipe can be done from the [📖 edit recipe page](../recipes/edit-recipe.md).

To add a label to a recipe, open the [📖 edit recipe page](../recipes/edit-recipe.md) and scroll to the bottom.  Here, you'll see a an area to assign labels to the recipe. To add a label, search for the label name you'd like to add to the recipe (whether it already exists or not!). If you're entering a label that does not exist, you'll see "click to create" as a suggestion. If you're entering a label that already exists, you'll see "click to select" as a suggestion. After you're done adding labels to your recipe, click the "save" button at the bottom of the page.

After assigning labels to your recipes, you can [📖 filter by label](./filtering.md).

*Note:* You can also [create & manage labels here](./manage-labels.md).
