title: Creating & Assigning Labels to Recipes
---

Labels are an excellent way of organizing your recipes. Think of labels as folders, but where a single recipe can be in multiple folders!

The process for creating a label is the same process as assigning an existing label to a given recipe. To add a label to a recipe, enter the label name in the field below the labels header as shown above, and press enter to save.

Suggestions will be shown below the field as you type - they will be filtered as you type your label name. You can click a suggestion to automatically add that label. To remove a label, just click the trash can icon.

After assigning labels to your recipes, you can [filter by label](./filtering.md).

**Note:** Labels only exist while they're assigned to a recipe. Once you remove a label from all recipes, the label will cease to exist. This is by design - labels are treated as tags.
