This section covers the [label manager](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).

## Label List

The [label manager](https://recipesage.com/#/labels) displays a list of all of the labels you currently have assigned to various recipes in your collection.

On this page, you can edit labels as well as do bulk operations based on those labels. This isn't the place to [filter by label](./filtering.md), or to [create or assign labels to recipes](./create.md).

## Deleting a Label

To delete a single label:
1. Navigate to the [label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the label you'd like to delete
3. Click "delete"

To delete multiple labels at once:
1. Navigate to the [label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Open the options menu in the top right corner
3. Click "Select Multiple Recipes"
4. Click each label in the list that you'd like to delete
5. Click the trashcan icon in the top bar

## Renaming a Label

1. Navigate to the [label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the label that you'd like to rename
3. Click "rename"
4. Enter the new label name
5. Click "okay"

Your label will now be renamed to the new name across all of the recipes that label is assigned to.

## Merging Two Labels

Merging two labels involves a "source" label, and a "destination" label. The "source" label will cease to exist, and all recipes that are tagged with the "source" label will instead have the "destination" label instead. After this process, the two labels will be merged into a single "destination" label.

1. Navigate to the [label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the "source" label you'd like to merge from
3. Click "Merge With Another Label"
4. Enter the name of the label you'd like to use as the "destination"
5. Click "confirm"

The "source" label will now no longer exist. All recipes that were previously tagged with the "source" label will now be tagged with the "destination" label.
