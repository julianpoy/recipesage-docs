This section covers the [ðŸ“± label manager](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).

## Label List

The [ðŸ“± label manager](https://recipesage.com/#/labels) displays a list of all of the labels & label categories you currently have in your collection.

On this page, you can edit labels & label categories as well as do bulk operations based on those labels. This isn't the place to [ðŸ“– filter by label](./filtering.md), or to [ðŸ“– create or assign labels to recipes](./create.md).

## Labels & Label Categories

*Labels* are the primary organization method within RecipeSage. They can be attached to recipes to organize & filter them later. Some common label examples are "breakfast", "dessert", and "vegetarian". It's strongly recommended that you start with adding labels for your collection before using label categories.

*Label categories* are "categories for labels" and can be used to organize multiple different labels into groups. Some examples of common label categories are: "meal", or "diet". For example, you might put the labels "breakfast", "lunch", and "dinner" under a label category called "meal". Many people don't even use label categories, though some find them quite useful for grouping labels together.

## Managing Labels

*Labels* are the primary organization method within RecipeSage. They can be attached to recipes to organize & filter them later.

### Creating a Label

To create a label:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the + button in the bottom right corner
3. Select "Create a label"
4. Enter a label name, such as "breakfast", "dessert", or "vegetarian"
5. Click "save"

You can now use the label you created when [ðŸ“– creating a recipe](../recipes/edit-recipe.md#creating-a-new-recipe) or when [ðŸ“– editing a recipe](../recipes/edit-recipe.md#editing-a-recipe), simply by entering the label name into the label selection box within the editing experience.

You can also create a label on the fly when [ðŸ“– creating a recipe](../recipes/edit-recipe.md#creating-a-new-recipe) or when [ðŸ“– editing a recipe](../recipes/edit-recipe.md#editing-a-recipe). Simply type a label name that does not exist into the label field while editing a recipe, and click the suggestion that says "create label".

### Deleting a Label

To delete a single label:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the label you'd like to delete
3. Click "delete"

To delete multiple labels at once:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Open the options menu in the top right corner
3. Click "Select Multiple Recipes"
4. Click each label in the list that you'd like to delete
5. Click the trashcan icon in the top bar

You can delete all recipes attached to a given label by clicking the "delete including recipes" button instead of the delete button. Note that this will result in the permenant deletion of all related recipes.

### Renaming a Label

1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the label that you'd like to rename
3. Click "rename"
4. Enter the new label name
5. Click "okay"

Your label will now be renamed to the new name across all of the recipes that label is assigned to.

### Merging Two Labels

Merging two labels involves a "source" label, and a "destination" label. The "source" label will cease to exist, and all recipes that are tagged with the "source" label will instead have the "destination" label instead. After this process, the two labels will be merged into a single "destination" label.

1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the "source" label you'd like to merge from
3. Click "Merge With Another Label"
4. Enter the name of the label you'd like to use as the "destination"
5. Click "confirm"

The "source" label will now no longer exist. All recipes that were previously tagged with the "source" label will now be tagged with the "destination" label.

## Managing Label Categories

*Label categories* are "categories for labels" and can be used to organize multiple different labels into groups. Some examples of common label categories are: "meal", or "diet". For example, you might put the labels "breakfast", "lunch", and "dinner" under a label category called "meal". Many people don't even use label categories, though some find them quite useful for grouping labels together.

### Creating a Label Category

To create a label category:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the + button in the bottom right corner
3. Select "Create a label category (advanced)"
4. Enter a label category name, such as "meal" or "diet"
5. Select the labels you'd like to be grouped under this category, for example "breakfast", "lunch", and "dinner".
6. Click "save"

Optional: Turning on the "warn me when I do not add" toggle will cause RecipeSage to display a warning if you do not add a label from this category when editing your recipe. For example if "warn me when I do not add" is enabled for the label category "meal", you will see a warning when creating a recipe without adding at least one of the labels "breakfast", "lunch", or "dinner". This can be useful to help you not forget to add certain labels to recipes.

### Renaming a Label Category

To rename a label category:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the label category you wish to rename
3. Change the label category name in the prompt displayed
4. Click "save"

### Adding or Removing Labels to/from a Label Category

To add or remove labels to/from a label category:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
2. Click the label category you wish to modify
3. Add labels from this category by typing a new label name in the search field, or click the trash can icon next to a label that you wish to remove from this category
4. Click "save"

### Deleting a Label Category

To delete a label category:
1. Navigate to the [ðŸ“± label management page](https://recipesage.com/#/labels).
