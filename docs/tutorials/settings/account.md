This name / nickname is what is displayed to other users when using any of the social or sharing features within the app.

# Email

Your account email is used for password reset and can be used by your friends to look you up in-app when sending messages or sharing recipes.

RecipeSage never sends or shares your email with third parties, I promise. You're also welcome to use an email alias, but please make sure you provide a valid and accessible email address, since it's vital if you want to regain access to your account in the event of a forgotten password.

To change your email, simply edit the email field and click the blue button that appears on the right side of the field.

# Password

Your account password is used to secure your RecipeSage account. It is vital that you use a secure password in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account. A unique password is recommended, and using a password manager to keep track of your passwords is recommended.

## Changing Your Password

To change your password, simply click the password field and enter a new password + password confirmation. then, click the blue button that appears on the right side of the confirm password field.

**Note:** After changing your password, all of your existing sessions across any devices you're currently logged into will be invalidated. If you're worried about someone else having access to your RecipeSage account, you can change your password in order to log any other devices out of your account.

# Stats

The stats displayed here are mainly for entertainment purposes. Here you can check your total recipe count, recipe image count, total message count, account creation date, and last login date.

# Bonus Feature Status

This section displays the status of the contributor-only bonus features. These features are particularly costly for me to host, and I unfortunately must limit them to contributors only. I try my best to keep all aspects of the app free & open to use.

You can check the status and expiration date of the contributor-only features you have access to here.

# Danger Zone

Be **very careful in this section**. All actions here are _completely irreversible_.

These actions may take several minutes to complete, especially if your collection is large.

## Deleting All Recipes

In rare cases you may want to delete all of the recipes within your account. This button can be used to remove all recipes from your account, but not other content (such as meal plans, shopping lists, etc) within the app.

## Deleting Your Account

This button will delete your account and all associated data from RecipeSage permenantly.
