title: Importing From Pepperplate
description: Import your Pepperplate recipes directly into RecipeSage using your account credentials. No active subscription required.
---

You can import recipes directly from Pepperplate by entering your account credentials on the import page. This will transfer all your recipes, including titles, ingredients, instructions, images, and metadata.

[https://recipesage.com/#/settings/import/pepperplate](https://recipesage.com/#/settings/import/pepperplate)

You don't need to have an active Pepperplate subscription to perform the import, only your account email and password. Your credentials are used temporarily to fetch your recipes and are not stored.

Please note that uploading files from a Pepperplate export is not supported, since they do not include structured metadata. You must use the direct account import method.
