title: Importing From PDFs
---

You can import recipes from PDF files. Each PDF file should contain one recipe.

**To import PDFs:**
1. Add all your PDF files to a `.zip` archive (one recipe per PDF)
2. Upload the `.zip` file via this page

The importer will extract text from each PDF and attempt to parse it as a recipe.

**Note:** The quality of the import depends on how well the text can be extracted from the PDF. Scanned PDFs or PDFs with complex layouts may not import as cleanly.
