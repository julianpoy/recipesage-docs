You can import recipes from plain text (`.txt`) files. Each text file should contain one recipe.

**To import text files:**
1. Add all your text files to a `.zip` archive
2. Upload the `.zip` file via this page

The importer will process each text file in the archive as a separate recipe and attempt to parse the ingredients and instructions.
