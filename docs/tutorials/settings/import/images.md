title: Importing From Images
---

You can import recipes from image files (such as photos of recipe cards or cookbook pages).

**To import images:**
1. Add all your image files to a `.zip` archive (one recipe per image)
2. Upload the `.zip` file via this page

The importer will use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from each image and attempt to parse it as a recipe.

**Supported image formats:**
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.gif`
- `.webp`

**Tip:** For best results, ensure images are clear, well-lit, and the text is legible. Blurry or low-quality images may not import accurately.
