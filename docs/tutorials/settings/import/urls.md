description: Import multiple recipes at once by providing a list of URLs. RecipeSage will fetch and parse each recipe automatically.
---

You can import recipes by providing a list of recipe URLs. RecipeSage will attempt to fetch and parse each URL using the autoclip functionality.

**To import from URLs:**
1. Enter each recipe URL on its own separate line
2. Only URLs starting with `http://` or `https://` are supported

**Important notes:**
- Some URLs may be unreachable or unparseable and will not be imported
- The quality of imported recipes depends on how well the source website is structured
- Consider contributing if your file contains a large number of recipes or images
