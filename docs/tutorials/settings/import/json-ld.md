title: Importing From JSON-LD
description: Import recipes from JSON-LD files into RecipeSage. JSON-LD is a standardized format supported by many recipe management applications.

JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a standardized format for structuring recipe data that follows Schema.org standards.

If your recipe program supports exporting to JSON-LD format, you can import those files directly into RecipeSage by uploading them via the import page.

**Please note** that not all files ending in `.json` are JSON-LD files, since `.json` is a very generic file format that comes in many shapes. Your file must be specifically a JSON-LD export from a recipe application.
