The options documented here apply to the `Side Menu -> Settings -> Export Recipe Data` page and the subpages withit.

## Supported Export Data Formats

RecipeSage supports exporting in the following formats:

- JSON-LD
- Plain Text
- PDF

JSON-LD can be re-imported later to RecipeSage via [📖 Importing From a JSON-LD File](./import/json-ld.md).

PDF can be used to save your recipes for offline use, or for printing purposes.

*Please note* that JSON is a very generic filetype internally, similar to a text document. Just because a different program asks for a .json file does not mean they'll be able to ingest one of the files exported by RecipeSage. Of course, if the program was designed to import a RecipeSage export in either of these formats, it'll be able to import from these filetypes.
